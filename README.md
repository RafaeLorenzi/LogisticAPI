# Logistic API

In this study project, a very simple delivery application model was created using Java, Spring, and MySQL. The objective was to study the creation of REST applications, focusing on best practices regarding application architecture, validations, and exception handling.

The application includes all CRUD methods related to the client, allowing the addition, modification, and removal of a client. Each client can perform one or more deliveries, and for each delivery, an occurrence is generated, which can change the delivery status.
